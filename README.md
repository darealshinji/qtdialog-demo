This is an attempt to create a file selector that can be loaded as an external
program or as a plugin. It's just a wrapper around QtFileDialog which should
automatically pick the right widget and toolkit depending on your environment.
It's just a small demo. Feel free to fork it if you think it's useful.

Building requires qmake and Qt development files. Tested on Qt5 and Linux.
